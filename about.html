        <h1>About us</h1>
        <h2>Time spent outdoors is time enjoyed!</h2>
        <p>We believe that spending time exploring the wilderness is a valuable gift and want everybody to be able to enjoy the outdoors no matter where they are. Regardless of whether you live in a cold part of the globe, on a tropical island, or on a place where the weather in unpredictable, we've got you covered! You'll always find what you're looking for within our wide range of jackets.</p>
        <a href="womens.html">Have a look at it here</a>
        <p>
          We started making quality sports apparel 50 years ago. After some trekking adventures we realised the sports clothing industry didn't offer what we were expecting of. We teamed up with sports scientists, expert mountaneers, and other well-known adventurers to bring to the market the best protective apparel we could come up with at most reasonable price. It goes without saying that the journey to achieve our goal didn't finish right after our firsts realeases, but rather we continue to test and improve every single one of our designs to make sure our products are unbeatable.
        </p>
        <p>
          When concerns about environmental footprints were raised, we took it personal to make the necessary changes to update our policies so that they comply with the latest guidelines. Keep reading to find out more.

        </p>
        <p>Rainy days is a private owned company that highly values its workforce. This is why we commit to a stress free environment and have a strong policy for social responsability. Regardless of where in the world you work for us, we are here to make sure you get a fair and humane treatment.</p>
        <h2>We aim at leaving the world a better place than we found it!</h2>
        <p>
          Because we are well aware that everything we make has a strong impact on our home planet, we're continuously implementing changes to our guidelines to ensure we achieve our sustainability goals. From the beginning of the 2000's all of our jackets are made of 50% recycled fabrics, and we've made it our mission to increase this number to 75% by the end of 2030. In addition to that, all of our designs are recyclable so we strongly encourage our customers to return those items that have seen better days to any of our selling points.
